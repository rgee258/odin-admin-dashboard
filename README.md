# Odin Admin Dashboard

In this repository is a mock up for a fake admin dashboard which is aptly named Panic Panel. Provided is an imaginary user interface for controlling some service with administrative access. Aside from essential navigation, additional information such as recent updates and recently logged in users are also listed. Just as one would expect from the name, the Panic Panel also provides a list of panic options that one can proceed with, as well as some commentary on why one would choose said respective option. Overall, it's a fun take on what should be an administrative tool.

The main purpose of this project was to become more comfortable with using CSS grid for setting up layouts. The majority of this mock up is done with grid, with some smaller touch ups such as button rows relying on flexbox. An interesting thing to note is that screen sizes where the viewport height is shorter than the bottom of the feed boxes will collapse the empty bottom grid row, cutting off the viewport at the last row of panic options. I'm unsure if this is a browser issue or an intended aspect of grid, as a brief search to try and fix it did not turn up much. It'll be kept as is as a result.
